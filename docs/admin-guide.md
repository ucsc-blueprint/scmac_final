# Admin Guide

This document explains how to manage the app as an administrator.

## Getting Started

- **Sign In** with your admin credentials.
- The bottom navigation bar will show additional links only admins can see, such as **Admin Events** and **Volunteers**.

## Managing Events

1. **Create Events**
   - Navigate to **Admin Events** and tap **Create Event**.
   - Fill out the event details: title, description, date, and any shifts.
   - Save the event to store it in Firestore and schedule reminders for volunteers.

2. **Edit or Duplicate Events**
   - From the Admin Events list, choose an event and tap **Edit** to modify details.
   - You can also duplicate an event to quickly create a similar one.

3. **Archive Events**
   - After an event is complete, you may archive it. This keeps the event history but removes it from the active list.

4. **Manage Shifts and Volunteers**
   - Within an individual event, you can see the list of shifts and which volunteers have signed up.
   - Tap a volunteer name to view their profile or remove them from a shift if needed.

## Sending Notifications

- Admins can send push notifications to all volunteers or to those registered for specific events.
- Use the **Send Message** option inside an event to broadcast important updates.

## Viewing Volunteers

- The **Volunteers** screen lists every registered user along with their contact information and interests.
- Export volunteer data as CSV if you need a roster for offline use.

## Tips and Best Practices

- Keep event details and shift times accurate so volunteers can plan accordingly.
- Regularly archive completed events to keep the app organized.
- Check the Notifications screen to verify messages have been delivered.

Happy organizing!
